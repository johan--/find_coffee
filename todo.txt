TODO:

SITE:

  - change it so that fonts aren't required from my hdd
  - make following search items work:
      - origin
      - roaster
  - make price button look better
  - change db/offering model so that blend origins aren't listed as unique:
    i.e. if a blend has kenya/guat and those coffees alreay exist in db, don't list it
    it a blend has kenya/guat/timor and only timor is unique, show timor,
      and then when a customer clicks on it link to the coffee that contains it
 
myDB:

  - create helper that returns all coffees from roaster that aren't on current list
  - then using that list, set all currently_available values to false

  - create helper that returns all coffees from given roaster
  - create another helper that compares all coffees from given roaster to
    currently available ones
  - another function adds only ones that aren't already in the db
  - HAS TO be a way to do this in SQL.
      - add all, keep it unique. ??
