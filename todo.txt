TODO:

SITE:

  - change it so that fonts aren't required from my hdd
  - create fake db with direct, blend, decaf, organic values set
      - add links and prices as well
  - make following search items work:
      - origin
      - roaster
      - blend/decaf/organic/direct_trade + more than one
      - only return coffees that are currently available
  - make form remain on page when looking at individual coffees
  - make price button look better
  - figure out why that one origin isn't being split into two
  - change db/offering model so that blend origins aren't listed as unique:
    i.e. if a blend has kenya/guat and those coffees alreay exist in db, don't list it
    it a blend has kenya/guat/timor and only timor is unique, show timor,
      and then when a customer clicks on it link to the coffee that contains it
 
myDB:

  - create helper that returns all coffees from roaster that aren't on current list
  - then using that list, set all currently_available values to false

  - create helper that returns all coffees from given roaster
  - create another helper that compares all coffees from given roaster to
    currently available ones
  - another function adds only ones that aren't already in the db
  - HAS TO be a way to do this in SQL.
      - add all, keep it unique. ??


  todo - today:

  - put form on #show action
  - update rails db:
        - some coffees are blend/decaf/organic/direct/currently available, some aren't
        - add fake prices/ links to all coffees:
  - change model/controller to only return coffees that are currently available
  - fix price button
