TODO:

- make site responsive
- change it so that fonts aren't required from my hdd
- make following search items work:
    - origin
    - roaster
    - blend/decaf/organic/direct_trade + more than one
- make form remain on page when looking at individual coffees
- make price button look better
- change db/offering model so that blend origins aren't listed as unique:
  i.e. if a blend has kenya/guat and those coffees alreay exist in db, don't list it
  it a blend has kenya/guat/timor and only timor is unique, show timor,
    and then when a customer clicks on it link to the coffee that contains it
